      "Early on a Sund ay, after first Mass in Clonegal, my father , instead of taking\n",
      "me home, drives deep into Wexford towards the coast where my mother ’s\n",
      "people came from. It is a hot day, bright, with patches of shade and\n",
      "greenish, sudden light along the road. We pass through the village of\n",
      "Shillelagh where my father lost our red Shorthorn in a game of forty-five,\n",
      "and on past the mart in Carnew where the man who won the heifer sold her\n",
      "shortly afterwards. My father throws his hat on the passenger seat, winds\n",
      "down the windo w, and smokes. I shake the plaits out of my hair and lie flat\n",
      "on the back seat, looking up through the rear window . In places there’ s a\n",
      "bare, blue sky. In places the blue sky is chalked over with clouds, but\n",
      "mostly it is a heady mixture of sky and trees scratched over by ESB wires\n",
      "across which, every now and then, small, brownish flocks of vanishing\n",
      "birds race.\n",
      "I wonde r what it will be like, this place belonging to the Kinsel las. I see\n",
      "a tall woman standing over me, making me drink milk still hot from the\n",
      "cow. I see another , less likely version of her in an apron, pouri ng pancake\n",
      "batter onto a frying pan, asking  would I like another , the way my mother\n",
      "sometimes does when she is in good humour . The man will be her size. He\n",
      "will take me to town on the tractor and buy me red lemonade and crisps. Or\n",
      "he’ll make me clean out sheds and pick stones and pull rag-wee d and docks\n",
      "out of the fields. I see him pulling what I hope will be a fifty-pence piece\n",
      "from his pocket but it turns out to be a handkerchief. I wonder if they live in\n",
      "an old farmhouse or a new bungalow , whether they will have an outhouse\n",
      "or an indoor bathroom with a toilet and running water . I picture myself\n",
      "lying in a dark bedroom with other girls, saying things we won’ t repeat\n",
      "when morning comes.\n",
      "An age, it seems, passes befor e the car slows and turns into a tarred,narrow lane, then a thrill as the wheels slam over the metal bars of a cattle\n",
      "grid. On either side, thick hedges are trimmed square. At the end of the lane\n",
      "there’ s a long, white house with trees whose limbs are trailing the ground.\n",
      "‘Da,’ I say . ‘The trees.’\n",
      "‘What about ’em?’\n",
      "‘They’re sick,’ I say .\n",
      "‘They’re weeping willows,’ he says, and clears his throat.\n",
      "In the yard, tall, shiny panes reflect our coming. I see myself looking out\n",
      "from the back seat wild as a tinker ’s child with my hair all loose but my\n",
      "father , at the wheel, looks just like my father . A big, loose hound whose\n",
      "coat is littered with the shadow s of the trees lets out a few rough, half-\n",
      "hearted barks, then sits on the step and looks back at the doorway where the\n",
      "man has come out to stand. He has a square body like the men my sisters\n",
      "sometimes draw , but his eyebro ws are white, to match his hair. He looks\n",
      "nothing like my mother ’s peop le, who are all tall with long arms, and I\n",
      "wonder if we have not come to the wrong house.\n",
      "‘Dan,’ he says, and tightens himself. ‘What way are you?’\n",
      "‘John,’ Da says.\n",
      "They stand, looking out over the yard for a moment and then they are\n",
      "talking rain: how little rain there is, how the fields need rain, how the priest\n",
      "in Kilm uckridge prayed for rain that very morning, how a summer like it\n",
      "was never before known. There is a pause during which my father spits and\n",
      "then the convers ation turns to the price of cattle, the EEC, butter mountains,\n",
      "the cost of lime and sheep-dip. It is something I am used to, this way men\n",
      "have of not talking: they like to kick a divot out of the grass with a boot\n",
      "heel, to slap the roof of a car before it takes off, to spit, to sit with their legs\n",
      "wide apart, as though they do not care.\n",
      "When the woman comes out, she pays no heed to the men. She is even\n",
      "taller than my mother with the same black hair but hers is cut tight like a\n",
      "helmet. She’s wearing a printed  blouse and brown, flared trousers. The car\n",
      "door is opened and I am taken out, and kissed. My face, being kissed, turns\n",
      "hot against hers.\n",
      "‘The last time I saw you, you were in the pram,’ she says, and stands\n",
      "back, expecting an answer .\n",
      "‘The pram’ s broken.’\n",
      "‘What happened at all?’‘My brother used it for a wheelbarrow and the wheel fell of f.’\n",
      "She laughs and licks her thumb  and wipes something off my face. I can\n",
      "feel her thumb, softer than my mother ’s, wiping whatever it is away. When\n",
      "she looks at my clothes, I see my thin, cotton dress, my dusty sandals\n",
      "through her eyes. There’ s a mom ent when neither one of us knows what to\n",
      "say. A queer , ripe breeze is crossing the yard.\n",
      "‘Come on in, a Leanbh.’\n",
      "She leads me into the house. There’ s a moment of darkness in the\n",
      "hallway; when I hesitate, she hesitates with me. We walk through into the\n",
      "heat of the kitchen where I am told to sit down, to make myself at home.\n",
      "Under the smell of baking there’ s some disinfectant, some bleach. She lifts\n",
      "a rhubar b tart out of the oven and puts it on the bench to cool: syrup on the\n",
      "point of bubbling over, thin leaves of pastry baked into the crust. A cool\n",
      "draught from the door blows in but here it is hot and still and clean. Tall ox-\n",
      "eyed daisies are still as the tall glass of water they are standing  in. There is\n",
      "no sign, anywhere, of a child.\n",
      "‘So how is your mammy keeping?’\n",
      "‘She won a tenner on the prize bonds.’\n",
      "‘She did not.’\n",
      "‘She did,’ I say. ‘We all had jelly and ice cream and she bought a new\n",
      "tube and a mending kit for the bicycle.’\n",
      "‘Well, wasn’ t that a treat.’\n",
      "‘It was,’ I say, and feel, again, the steel teeth of the comb against my\n",
      "scalp earlier that morning, the strength of my mother ’s hands as she wove\n",
      "the plaits tight, her belly at my back, hard with the next baby . I think of the\n",
      "clean pants she packed in the suitcase, the letter , and what she may have\n",
      "written. W ords had passed between them:\n",
      "‘How long should they keep her?’\n",
      "‘Can’ t they keep her as long as they like?’\n",
      "‘Is that what I’ll say?’\n",
      "‘Say what you like. Isn’ t it what you always do.’\n",
      "Now , the woman fills an enamel jug with milk.\n",
      "‘Your mother must be busy .’\n",
      "‘She’ s waiting for them to come and cut the hay .’\n",
      "‘Have ye not the hay cut?’ she says. ‘Aren’ t ye late?’\n",
      "When the men come in from the yard, it grows momentarily dark, thenbrightens once again when they sit down.\n",
      "‘Well, Missus,’ says Da, pulling out a chair .\n",
      "‘Dan,’ she says, in a dif ferent voice.\n",
      "‘There’ s a scorcher of a day .’\n",
      "‘’Tis hot, surely .’ She turns her back to watch the kettle, waiting.\n",
      "‘Wouldn’ t the fields be glad of a sup of rain,’ he says.\n",
      "‘Won’t we have the rain for long enough.’ She looks at the wall as\n",
      "though a picture is hanging there but there is no picture on that wall, just a\n",
      "big mahogany clock with two hands and a big copper pendulum, swinging.\n",
      "‘Wasn’t it a great year for the hay all the same. Never saw the like of it,’\n",
      "says Da. ‘The loft is full to capacity . I nearly split my head on the rafters\n",
      "pitching it in.’\n",
      "I wonder why my father lies about the hay. He is given to lying about\n",
      "things that would be nice, if they were true. Somewhere, further off,\n",
      "someone has started up a chainsaw and it drones on like a big, stinging\n",
      "wasp for a while in the distan ce. I wish I was out there, working.  I am\n",
      "unused to sitting still and do not know what to do with my hands. Part of\n",
      "me wants my father to leave me here while another part of me wants him to\n",
      "take me back, to what I know . I am in a spot where I can neither be what I\n",
      "always am nor turn into what I could be.\n",
      "The kettle lets off steam and rumbles up to boiling point, its steel lid\n",
      "clapping. The presence of a black-and-white cat moves on the window\n",
      "ledge. On the floor , across the hard, clean tiles, the woman’ s shadow\n",
      "stretches, almos t reaching my chair. Kinsella gets up and takes a stack of\n",
      "plates from the cupboard, opens a drawer and takes out knives and forks,\n",
      "teaspoons. He takes the lid off a jar of beetroot and puts it on a saucer with\n",
      "a little serving fork, leaves out sandwich spread and salad cream. My father\n",
      "watches closely as he does this. Already there’ s a bowl of tomatoes and\n",
      "onions, chopped fine, a fresh loaf, a block of red cheddar .\n",
      "‘And what way is Mary?’ the woman says.\n",
      "‘Mary? She’ s coming near her time.’ Da sits back, satisfied.\n",
      "‘I suppose the last babby is getting hardy?’\n",
      "‘Aye,’ Da says. ‘It’s the feedi ng them that’s the trouble. There’ s no\n",
      "appetite like a child’ s and, believe you me, this one is no dif ferent.’\n",
      "‘Ah, don’t we all eat in spurts, the same as we grow ,’ says the woman, as\n",
      "though this is something he should know .‘She’ll ate but you can work her .’\n",
      "Kinsella looks up. ‘There’ll be no need for any of that,’ he says. ‘The\n",
      "child will have no more to do than help Edna around the house.’\n",
      "‘We’ll keep the child gladly ,’ the woman echoes. ‘She’ s welcome here.’\n",
      "‘She’ll ate ye out of house and home,’ Da says, ‘but I don’t suppose\n",
      "there’ll be a word about it this time twelve months.’\n",
      "When we sit in at the table, Da reaches for the beetroot. He doesn’t use\n",
      "the serving fork but pitches it onto the plate with his own. It stains the pink\n",
      "ham, bleeds. Tea is poured. Ther e’s a patchy silence as we eat, as our knives\n",
      "and forks break up what’ s on our plates. Then, after some time, the tart is\n",
      "cut. Cream falls over the hot pastry , into pools.\n",
      "Now that my father has delivered me and eaten his fill, he is anxious to\n",
      "light his fag and get away . Always, it’s the same: he never stays in any\n",
      "place long after he’s eaten, not like my mother who would talk until it grew\n",
      "dark and light again. This, at least, is what my father says even though I\n",
      "have never known it to happen. With my mother it is all work: us, the\n",
      "butter -making, the dinners, the washing up and getting up and getting ready\n",
      "for Mass and school, weaning calves, and hiring men to plough and harrow\n",
      "the fields, stretching the money and setting the alarm. But this is a different\n",
      "type of house. Here there is room, and time to think. There may even be\n",
      "money to spare.\n",
      "‘I’d better hit the road,’ Da says.\n",
      "‘What hurry is on you?’ Kinsella says.\n",
      "‘The daylight is burning, and I’ve yet the spuds to spray .’\n",
      "‘There’ s no fear of blight these evenings,’ the woman says, but she rises\n",
      "anyway , picks up the sharp knife and goes out the back door. I want to go\n",
      "with her, to shake the clay off whatever she cuts and carry it back into the\n",
      "house. A type of silence climbs and grows tall between the men while she is\n",
      "out.\n",
      "‘Give this to Mary,’ she says, coming in. ‘I’m snowed under with\n",
      "rhubarb, whatever kind of year it is.’\n",
      "My father takes it from her but it is as awkward as the baby in his arms.\n",
      "A stalk falls to the floor and then another . He waits for her to pick it up, to\n",
      "hand it to him. She waits for him to do it. Neither one of them will budge.\n",
      "In the end, it’ s Kinsella who stoops to lift it.\n",
      "‘There now ,’ he says.Out in the yard, my father throws the rhubarb onto the back seat, gets in\n",
      "behind the wheel and starts the engine.\n",
      "‘Good luck to ye,’ he says. ‘I hope this girl will give no trouble.’ He\n",
      "turns to me then. ‘T ry not to fall into the fire, you.’\n",
      "I watch him reverse, turn into the lane, and drive away . I hear the wheels\n",
      "slam over the cattle grid, then the changing of gears and the noise of the\n",
      "motor going back the road we came. Why did he leave without so much as\n",
      "a good-bye, without ever mentio ning that he would come back for me? The\n",
      "strange, ripe breeze that’s crossing the yard feels cooler now, and big white\n",
      "clouds have marched in across the barn.\n",
      "‘What’ s ailing you, Child?’ the woman says.\n",
      "I look at my feet, dirty in my sandals.\n",
      "Kinsella stands in close. ‘Whatever it is, tell us. W e won’ t mind.’\n",
      "‘Lord God Almighty , didn’ t he go and forget all about your bits and\n",
      "bobs!’ the woman says. ‘No wonder you’re in a state. Well, hasn’ t he a head\n",
      "like a sieve, the same man.’\n",
      "‘What matter ,’ Kinsella says. ‘W e’ll have you togged out in no time.’\n",
      "‘There won’t be a word about it this time twelve months,’ the woman\n",
      "says.\n",
      "They laugh hard for a moment then stop. When I follow the woman back\n",
      "inside, I want her to say something, to put my mind at ease. Instead, she\n",
      "clears the table, picks up the sharp knife and stands in the light under the\n",
      "window , washin g the blade under the running tap. She stares at me as she\n",
      "wipes it clean, and puts it away .\n",
      "‘Now , Girleen,’ she says. ‘I think it’ s past time you had a bath.’\n",
      "OceanofPDF .com2\n",
      "Beyond the kitchen, carpeted steps lead to an open room. There’ s a big\n",
      "double bed with a candlewick spread, and lamps at either side. This, I know ,\n",
      "is where they sleep, and I’m glad, for some reason, that they sleep together .\n",
      "The woman takes me through to a bathroom, plugs a drain and turns the\n",
      "taps on full. The bath fills and the white room changes so that a type of\n",
      "blindness comes over us; we can see everything and yet we can’ t see.\n",
      "‘Hands up,’ she says, and takes my dress of f.\n",
      "She tests the water and I step in, trusting her , but the water is too hot.\n",
      "‘Get in,’ she says.\n",
      "‘It’s too hot.’\n",
      "‘You’ll get used to it.’\n",
      "I put one foot through the steam and feel, again, the same rough  scald. I\n",
      "keep my foot in the water , and then, when I think I can’t stand it any longer ,\n",
      "my thinking changes, and I can. This water is deeper than any I have ever\n",
      "bathed in. Our mother bathes us in what little she can, and makes us share.\n",
      "After a while, I lie back and through the steam watch the woman as she\n",
      "scrubs my feet. The dirt under my nails she prises out with tweezers. She\n",
      "squeezes shamp oo from a plastic  bottle, lathers my hair and rinses the lather\n",
      "off. Then she makes me stand and soaps me all over with a cloth . Her hands\n",
      "are like my mother ’s hands but there is something else in them too,\n",
      "something I have never felt before and have no name for. I feel at such a\n",
      "loss for words but this is a new place, and new words are needed.\n",
      "‘Now your clothes,’ she says.\n",
      "‘I don’ t have any clothes.’\n",
      "‘Of course you don’ t.’ She pauses. ‘W ould some of our old things do you\n",
      "for now?’\n",
      "‘I don’ t mind.’‘Good girl.’\n",
      "She takes me to another bedroom past theirs, at the other side of the\n",
      "stairs, and looks through a chest of drawers.\n",
      "‘Maybe these will fit you.’\n",
      "She is holding a pair of old-fashioned trousers and a new plaid shirt. The\n",
      "sleeves and legs are too long but she rolls them up, and tightens the waist\n",
      "with a canvas belt, to fit me.\n",
      "‘There now ,’ she says.\n",
      "‘Mammy says I have to change my pants every day .’\n",
      "‘And what else does your mammy say?’\n",
      "‘She says you can keep me for as long as you like.’\n",
      "She laughs at this and brushes the knots out of my hair, and turns quiet.\n",
      "The windows in this room are open and through these I see a stretch of\n",
      "lawn, a vegetabl e garden, edible things growing in rows, red spiky dahlias,\n",
      "a crow with something in his beak which he slowly breaks in two and eats,\n",
      "one half and then the other .\n",
      "‘Come down to the well with me,’ she says.\n",
      "‘Now?’\n",
      "‘Does now not suit you?’\n",
      "Something abou t the way she says this makes me wonde r if it’s\n",
      "something we are not supposed to do.\n",
      "‘Is this a secret?’\n",
      "‘What?’\n",
      "‘I mean, am I not supposed to tell?’\n",
      "She turns me round, to face her. I have not really looked into her eyes,\n",
      "until now. Her eyes are dark blue pebbled with other blues. In this light she\n",
      "has a moustache.\n",
      "‘There are no secrets in this house, do you hear?’\n",
      "I don’ t want to answer back but feel she wants an answer .\n",
      "‘Do you hear me?’\n",
      "‘Yeah.’\n",
      "‘It’s not “yeah”. It’ s “yes”. What is it?’\n",
      "‘It’s yes.’\n",
      "‘Yes, what?’\n",
      "‘Yes, there are no secrets in this house.’\n",
      "‘Where there’ s a secret,’ she says, ‘there’ s shame, and shame issomething we can do without.’\n",
      "‘Okay .’ I take big breaths so I won’ t cry.\n",
      "She puts her arm around me. ‘Y ou’re just too young to understand.’\n",
      "As soon as she says this, I realise she is just like everyone else, and wish\n",
      "I was back at home so that all the things I do not understand could be the\n",
      "same as they always are.\n",
      "Downstairs, she fetches the zinc bucket from the scullery and takes me\n",
      "down the fields. At first I feel uneasy in the strange clothes but walking\n",
      "along I forget. Kinsella’ s fields  are broad and level, divided in strips with\n",
      "electric fences she says I must not touch, unless I want a shock . When the\n",
      "wind blows, sections of the longer grass bend over, turning silver. On one\n",
      "strip of land, tall Friesian cows stand all around us, grazing. Some of them\n",
      "look up as we pass but not one of them moves away . They have huge bags\n",
      "of milk and long teats. I can hear them pulling the grass up from the roots.\n",
      "The breeze, crossing the rim of the bucket, whispers as we walk along.\n",
      "Neither one of us talks, the way people sometimes don’t when they are\n",
      "happy . As soon as I have this thought I realise its opposite is also true. We\n",
      "climb over a stile and follow a dry path worn through the grass. The path\n",
      "snakes through a long field over which white butterflies skim and dart, and\n",
      "we wind up at a small iron gate where stone steps run down to a well. The\n",
      "woman leaves the bucket on the grass and comes down with me.\n",
      "‘Look,’ she says, ‘what water is here. Who’d ever think there wasn’ t so\n",

      "‘God forgive me but if I ever run into that woman again it will be too\n",
      "soon,’ says Mrs Kinsella, when we have turned the corner .\n",
      "We go to the butchers for rashers and sausages and a horseshoe of black\n",
      "pudding, to the chemist where she asks for Aunt Acid, and then on down to\n",
      "a little shop she calls the gift gallery where they sell cards and notepaper\n",
      "and pretty pieces of jewellery from a case of revolving shelves.\n",
      "‘Isn’t your mammy’ s birthday coming up shortly?’\n",
      "‘Yes,’ I say , without being sure.\n",
      "‘We’ll get a card for her , so.’\n",
      "She tells me to choose, and I pick a card with a frightened-looking cat\n",
      "sitting in front of a bed of yellow dahlias.\n",
      "‘Not long now till they’ll be back to school,’ says the woman behind the\n",
      "counter . ‘Isn’ t it a great relief to have them of f your back?’\n",
      "‘This one is no trouble,’ Mrs Kinsella says, and pays for the card along\n",
      "with some sheets of notepaper and a packet of envelopes. ‘It’s only missing\n",
      "her I’ll be when she is gone.’\n",
      "‘Humph,’ the woman says.\n",
      "Before we go back to the car she lets me loose in a sweet shop. I take my\n",
      "time choosing, hand over the pound note and take back the change.‘Didn’ t you stretch it well,’ she says, when I come out.\n",
      "Kinsella is parked in the shade, with the windows open, reading the\n",
      "newspaper .\n",
      "‘Well?’ he says. ‘Did ye get sorted?’\n",
      "‘Aye,’ she says.\n",
      "‘Grand,’ he says.\n",
      "I give him the Choc-ice and her the Flake and lie on the back seat eating\n",
      "the hard gums, careful not to choke as we cross over bumps in the road. I\n",
      "listen to the change rattling in my pocket, the wind rushing through the car\n",
      "and their talk, scraps of news being shared between them in the front.\n",
      "When we turn into the yard, another car is parked outside the door. A\n",
      "woman is on the front step, pacing, with her arms crossed.\n",
      "‘Isn’t that Harry Redmond’ s girl?’\n",
      "‘I don’ t like the look of this,’ says Kinsella.\n",
      "‘Oh, John,’ she says, rushing over. ‘I’m sorry to trouble you but didn’ t\n",
      "our Michael pass away and there’s not a soul at home. They’re all out on\n",
      "the combines and won’ t be back  till God knows what hour and I’ve no way\n",
      "of getting word to them. We’re rightly stuck. Would you ever come down\n",
      "and give us a hand digging the grave?’\n",
      " \n",
      "‘I don’t know that this’ll be any place for you but I can’t leave you here,’\n",
      "the wom an says, later that same day. ‘So get ready and we’ll go, in the\n",
      "name of God.’\n",
      "I go upstairs and change into the new dress, the ankle socks and shoes.\n",
      "‘Don’ t you look nice,’ she says, when I come down. ‘John’ s not always\n",
      "easy but he’ s hardly ever wrong.’\n",
      "Walking down the road, there’ s a taste of something darker in the air, of\n",
      "something that might come and fall and change things. We pass houses\n",
      "whose doors and windows are wide open, long, flapping clotheslines,\n",
      "gravelled entrances to other lanes. At the bend, a bay pony is leaning up\n",
      "against a gate, but when I reach out to stroke his nose, he whinnies and\n",
      "canters off. Outside a cottage, a black dog with curls all down his back\n",
      "comes out and barks at us, hotly , through the bars of a gate. At the first\n",
      "crossroads, we meet a heifer who panics and finally races past us, lost. All\n",
      "through the walk, the wind blow s hard and soft and hard again through the\n",
      "tall, flowering hedges, the high trees. In the fields, the combines are outcutting the whea t, the barley and oats, saving the corn, leaving behind long\n",
      "rows of straw . We meet men on tractors, going in different directions,\n",
      "pulling balers to the fields, and trailers full of grain to the co-op. Birds\n",
      "swoop down, brazen, eating the fallen seed off the middle of the road.\n",
      "Further along, we meet two barechested men, their eyes so white  in faces so\n",
      "tanned and dusty .\n",
      "The woman stops to greet them and tells them where we are going.\n",
      "‘God rest him. Didn’ t he go quick in the end?’ one man says.\n",
      "‘Aye,’ says the other. ‘But didn’ t he reach his three score and ten? What\n",
      "more can any of us hope for?’\n",
      "We keep on walking, standing in tight to the hedges, the ditches, letting\n",
      "things pass.\n",
      "‘Have you been to a wake before?’ the woman asks.\n",
      "‘I don’ t think so.’\n",
      "‘Well, I might as well tell you: there will be a dead man here in a coffin\n",
      "and lots of people and some of them might have a little too much taken.’\n",
      "‘What will they be taking?’\n",
      "‘Drink,’ she says.\n",
      "When we come to the house, several men are leaning against a low wall,\n",
      "smoking. There’ s a black ribbon on the door and hardly a light shining from\n",
      "the house but when we go in, the kitchen is bright, and packed with people\n",
      "who are talking. The woman who asked Kinsella to dig the grave is there,\n",
      "making sandwiches. There are big bottles of red and white lemonade, stout,\n",
      "and in the middle of all this, a big wooden box with an old dead man lying\n",
      "inside of it. His hands are joined as though he had died praying , a string of\n",
      "rosary beads around his fingers. Some of the men are sitting around the\n",
      "coffin, using the part that’s closed as a counter on which to rest their\n",
      "glasses. One of these is Kinsella.\n",
      "‘There she is,’ he says. ‘Long Legs. Come over here.’\n",
      "He pulls me onto his lap, and gives me a sip from his glass.\n",
      "‘Do you like the taste of that?’\n",
      "‘No.’\n",
      "He laughs. ‘Good girl. Don’ t ever get a taste for it. If you start, you\n",
      "might never stop and then you’d wind up like the rest of us.’\n",
      "He pours red lemonade into a cup for me. I sit on his lap drinking it and\n",
      "eating the queen cakes out of the biscuit tin and looking at the dead man,hoping his eyes will open.\n",
      "The people come and go, drifting in and out, shaking hands, drinking\n",
      "and eating and looking at the dead man, saying what a lovely corpse he is,\n",
      "and doesn’ t he look happy now that his end has come, and who was it that\n",
      "laid him out? They talk of the forecast and the moisture content of corn, of\n",
      "milk quotas and the next gener al election. I feel myself gettin g heavy on\n",
      "Kinsella’ s lap.\n",
      "‘Am I getting heavy?’\n",
      "‘Heavy?’ he says. ‘Y ou’re like a feather , Child. Stay where you are.’\n",
      "I put my head against him but I’m bored and wish there were things to\n",
      "do, other children who would play .\n",
      "‘The girl’ s getting uneasy ,’ I hear the woman say .\n",
      "‘What’ s ailing her?’ says another .\n",
      "‘Ah, it’s no place for the child, really ,’ she says. ‘It’s just I didn’ t like not\n",
      "to come, and I wouldn’ t leave her behind.’\n",
      "‘Sure I’ll take her home with me, Edna. I’m going now. Can’ t you call in\n",
      "and collect her on your way?’\n",
      "‘Oh,’ she says. ‘I don’ t know should I.’\n",
      "‘Mine’d be a bit of company for her. Can’ t they play away out the back?\n",
      "And that man there won’ t budge as long as he has her on his knee.’\n",
      "Mrs Kinsella laughs. I’ve never heard her laugh like this.\n",
      "‘Sure maybe, if you don’t mind, you would, Mildred,’ she says. ‘What\n",
      "harm is in it? And you know we’ll not be long after you.’\n",
      "‘Not a bother ,’ the woman says.\n",
      "When we are out on the road, and the goodbyes are said, Mildre d strides\n",
      "on into a pace I can just about keep, and as soon as she rounds the bend, the\n",
      "questions start. She is eaten alive with curiosity; hardly is one question\n",
      "answered before  the next is fired: ‘Which room did they put you into? Did\n",
      "Kinsella give you money? How  much? Does she drink at night? Does he?\n",
      "Are they playin g cards up there much? Who was there? Wha t were they\n",
      "selling the lines for? Do ye say the rosary? Does she put butter or mar garine\n",
      "in her pastry? Where does the old dog sleep? Is the freezer packed solid?\n",
      "Does she skimp on things or is she allowed to spend? Are the child’ s\n",
      "clothes still hanging in the wardrobe?’\n",
      "I answer them all easily , until the last.\n",
      "‘The child’ s clothes?’‘Aye,’ she says.  ‘Sure if you’re  sleeping in his room you must surely\n",
      "know . Did you not look?’\n",
      "‘Well, she had clothes I wore for all the time I was here but we went to\n",
      "Gorey this morning and bought all new things.’\n",
      "‘This rig-out you’re wearing now? God Almighty ,’ she says. ‘Anybody\n",
      "would think you were going on for a hundred.’\n",
      "‘I like it,’ I say . ‘They told me it was flattering.’\n",
      "‘Flattering, is it? Well. Well,’ she says. ‘I suppose it is, after living in the\n",
      "dead’ s clothes all this time.’\n",
      "‘What?’\n",
      "‘The Kinsellas’ young lad, you dope. Did you not know?’\n",
      "I don’ t know what to say .\n",
      "‘That must have been some stone they rolled back to find you. Sure\n",
      "didn’ t he follow that auld hound of theirs into the slurry tank and drown?\n",
      "That’ s what they say happened anyhow ,’ she says.\n",
      "I keep on walking and try not to think about what she has said even\n",
      "though I can think of little else. The time for the sun to go down is getting\n",
      "close but the day feels like it isn’t ending. I look at the sky and see the sun,\n",
      "still high, and clouds, and, far away , a round moon coming out.\n",
      "‘They say John got the gun and took the hound down the field but he\n",
      "hadn’ t the heart to shoot him, the softhearted fool.’\n",
      "We walk on between the bristling hedges in which small things seem to\n",
      "rustle and move. Chamomile grows along these ditches, wood sage and\n",
      "mint, plants whose names my mother somehow found the time to teach me.\n",
      "Further along, the same lost heifer is still lost, in a different part of the road.\n",
      "‘And you know , the pair of them turned white overnight.’\n",
      "‘What do you mean?’\n",
      "‘Their hair , what else?’\n",
      "‘But Mrs Kinsella’ s hair is black.’\n",
      "‘Black? A ye, black out of the dye-pot, you mean.’ She laughs.\n",
      "I wonder at her laughing like this. I wonder at the clothes and how I’d\n",
      "worn them and the boy in the wallpaper and how I never put it all together .\n",
      "Soon we come to the place where the black dog is barking through the bars\n",
      "of the gate.\n",
      "‘Shut up and get in, you,’ she says to him.\n",
      "It’s a cottage she lives in with uneven slabs of concrete outside the frontdoor, over grown shrubs, and tall Red Hot Pokers growing out of the ground.\n",
      "Here I must watch my head, my step. When we go in, the place  is cluttered\n",
      "and an older woman is smoking at the cooker . There’ s a baby in a high\n",
      "chair . He lets out a cry when he sees the woman and drops a handful of\n",
      "marrowfat peas over the edge.\n",
      "‘Look at you,’ she says. ‘The state of you.’\n",
      "I’m not sure if it’s the woman or the child she is talking to. She takes off\n",
      "her cardigan and sits down and starts talking about the wake: who was\n",
      "there, the type of sandwiches that were made, the queen cakes, the corpse\n",
      "who was lying up crooked in the coffin and hadn’ t even been shaved\n",
      "properly , how they had plastic rosary beads for him, the poor fucker .\n",
      "I don’t know whether to sit or stand, to listen or leave but just as I’m\n",
      "deciding what to do, the dog barks and the gate opens and Kinsella comes\n",
      "in, stooping under the door frame.\n",
      "‘Good evening all,’ he says.\n",
      "‘Ah, John,’ the woman says. ‘You weren’ t long. We’re only in the door.\n",
      "Aren’ t we only in the door , Child?’\n",
      "‘Yes.’\n",
      "Kinsella hasn’ t taken his eyes off me. ‘Thanks, Mildred. It was good of\n",
      "you, to take her home.’\n",
      "‘It was nothing,’ the woman says. ‘She’ s a quiet young one, this.’\n",
      "‘She says what she has to say, and no more. May there be many like her,’\n",
      "he says. ‘Are you ready to come home, Petal?’\n",
      "I get up and he talks on a little, to smooth things over , the way people do.\n",
      "I follow him out to the car where the woman is waiting.\n",
      "‘Were you alright in there?’ she says.\n",
      "I say I was.\n",
      "‘Did she ask you anything?’\n",
      "‘A few things, nothing much.’\n",
      "‘What did she ask you?’\n",
      "‘She asked me if you used butter or mar garine in your pastry .’\n",
      "‘Did she ask you anything else?’\n",
      "‘She asked me was the freezer packed tight.’\n",
      "‘There you are,’ says Kinsella.\n",
      "‘Did she tell you anything?’ the woman asks.\n",
      "I don’ t know what to say .‘What did she tell you?’\n",
      "‘She told me you had a little boy who followed the dog into the slurry\n",
      "tank and died, and that I wore his clothes to Mass last Sunday .’\n",
      " \n",
      "When we get home, the hound gets up and comes out to the car to greet us.\n",
      "It’s only now I realise I’ve not heard either one of them call him by his\n",
      "name. Kinsella sighs and goes off to milk. When he comes inside, he says\n",
      "he’s not ready for bed and that there will be no visitors tonight anyhow , on\n",
      "account of the wake – not, he says, that he wants any. The woman goes\n",
      "upstairs and changes and comes back down in her nightdress. Kinsella has\n",
      "taken my shoes of f and has put what I now know is the boy’ s jacket on me.\n",
      "‘What are you doing now?’ she says.\n",
      "‘What does it look like? And she’ll break her neck in these.’\n",
      "He goes out, stumbling a little, then comes back in with a sheet of\n",
      "sandpaper and scuf fs up the soles of my new shoes so I will not slip.\n",
      "‘Come on,’ he says. ‘W e’ll break them in.’\n",
      "‘Didn’ t she already break them in? Where are you taking her?’\n",
      "‘Only as far as the strand,’ he says.\n",
      "‘You’ll be carefu l with that girl, John Kinsella,’ she says. ‘And don’t you\n",
      "go without the lamp.’\n",
      "‘What need is there for a lamp on a night like tonight?’ he says but he\n",
      "takes it anyhow , as it’ s handed to him.\n",
      "There’ s a big moon shining on the yard, chalking our way onto the lane\n",
      "and along the road. Kinsella takes my hand in his. As soon as he takes it, I\n",
      "realise my father has never once  held my hand, and some part of me wants\n",
      "Kinsella to let me go so I won’ t have to feel this. It’s a hard feeling but as\n",
      "we walk  along I begin to settle  and let the difference between  my life at\n",
      "home and the one I have here be. He takes small steps so we can walk in\n",
      "time. I think about the woman in the cottage, of how she walked and spoke,\n",
      "and conclude that there are huge dif ferences between people.\n",
      "When we reach the crossroads we turn right, down a steep, sloping road.\n",
      "The wind is high and hoarse in the trees, tearing fretfully through the dry\n",
      "boughs, when their leaves rise and swing. It’s sweet to feel the open road\n",
      "falling away under us, knowing we will, at its end, come to the sea. The\n",
      "road goes on and the sky, everything, seems to get brighter . Kinsella says a\n",
      "few meaningless things along the way then falls into the quiet way he hasabout him, and time passes without seeming to pass and then we are in a\n",
      "sandy , open space where people must park cars. It is full of tyre marks and\n",
      "potholes, a rubbish bin which seems not to have been emptied in a long\n",
      "time.\n",
      "‘We’re almost there now , Petal.’\n",
      "He leads  me up a steep hill where, on either side, tall rushes bend and\n",
      "shake. My feet sink in the deep  sand, and the climb takes my breath away .\n",
      "Then we are standing on the crest of a dark place where the land ends and\n",
      "there is a long strand and water which I know is deep and stretches all the\n",
      "way to England. Far out, in the darkness, two bright lights are blinking.\n",
      "Kinsella lets me loose and I race down the far side of the dune to the\n",
      "place where the black sea hisses up into loud, frothy waves. I run towards\n",
      "them as they back away and run back, shrieking, when another crashes in.\n",
      "When Kinsella catches up, we take our shoes off. In places we walk along\n",
      "with the edge of the sea clawing at the sand under our bare feet. In places he\n",
      "leaves me to run. At one point we go in until the water is up to his knees\n",
      "and he holds me on his shoulders.\n",
      "‘Don’ t be afraid!’ he says.\n",
      "‘What?’\n",
      "‘Don’ t be afraid!’\n",
      "The strand is all washed clean, without so much as a footprint. Beyond a\n",
      "crooked line in the sand, close to the dunes, things have washed up: plastic\n",
      "bottles, sticks, the handle of a mop whose head is lost and, further on, a\n",
      "stable door , whose bolt is broken.\n",
      "‘Some man’s horse is loose tonight,’ Kinsella says. He walks on for a\n",
      "while then. It is quieter up here, away from the noise of the waves. ‘You\n",
      "know the fishermen sometimes find horses out at sea. A man I know towed\n",
      "a colt in one time and the horse lay down for a long time before he got up.\n",
      "And he was perfect. T iredness was all it was, after being out so long.\n",
      "‘Strange things happen,’ he says. ‘A strange thing happened to you\n",
      "tonight but Edna meant no harm. It’s too good, she is. She wants to find the\n",
      "good in others, and sometimes  her way of finding that is to trust them,\n",
      "hoping she’ll not be disappointed but she sometimes is.’\n",
      "He laughs then, a queer , sad laugh. I don’ t know what to say .\n",
      "‘You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he says. ‘Always remem ber that\n",
      "as a thing you need never do. Many’ s the man lost much just because hemissed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.’\n",
      "Everything abou t the night feels strange: to walk to a sea that’s always\n",
      "been there, to see it and feel it and fear it in the half dark, and to listen to\n",
      "this man saying things about horses out at sea, about his wife trusting others\n",
      "so she’ll  learn who not to trust, things I don’t fully understand, things which\n",
      "may not even be intended for me.\n",
      "We keep  on walking until we come to a place where the cliffs and rocks\n",
      "come out to meet the water . Now that we can go no farther , we must turn\n",
      "back. Maybe the way back will somehow make sense of the coming. Here\n",
      "and there, flat white shells lie shining and washed up on the sand. I stoop to\n",
      "gather them. They feel smooth and clean and brittle in my hands. We turn\n",
      "back along the beach and walk on, seeming to walk a greater distance than\n",
      "the one we crossed in reaching the place where we could not pass, and then\n",
      "the moon disappears behind a darkish cloud and we cannot see where we\n",
      "are going. At this point, Kinsella lets out a sigh, stops, and lights the lamp.\n",
      "‘Ah, the women are nearly alwa ys right, all the same,’ he says. ‘Do you\n",
      "know what the women have a gift for?’\n",
      "‘What?’\n",
      "‘Eventualities. A good woman can look far down the line and smell\n",

      "He shines the light along the strand to find our footprints, to follow them\n",
      "back, but the only prints he can find are mine.\n",
      "‘You must have carried me there,’ he says.\n",
      "I laugh at the thought of me carrying him, at the impossibi lity, then\n",
      "realise it was a joke, and that I got it.\n",
      "When the moon comes out again, he turns the lamp off and by the\n",
      "moon’ s light we easily find and follow the path we took out of the dunes.\n",
      "When we reach the top, he won’ t let me put my shoes on but does it for me.\n",
      "Then he does his own and knots the laces. We stand then, to pause and look\n",
      "back out at the water .\n",
      "‘See, there’ s three lights now where there was only two before.’\n",
      "I look out across  the sea. There,  the two lights are blinking as before, but\n",
      "with another , steady light, shining there also.\n",
      "‘Can you see it?’ he says.\n",
      "‘I can,’ I say . ‘It’s there.’\n",
      "And that is when he puts his arms around me and gathers me into themas though I were his.\n",

      "Mrs Kinsella stands then and they say their good-byes and go outside. I\n",
      "follow them out to the car with my mother who still has the baby in her\n",
      "arms. Kinsella lifts out the box of jam, the four -stone sack of potatoes.\n",
      "‘These are floury ,’ he says. ‘Queens they are, Mary .’\n",

      "something I need ever mention. It is my perfect opportunity to say nothing.\n",
      "I hear the car braking on the gravel in the lane, the door opening, and\n",
      "then I am doing what I do best. It’s nothing I have to think abou t. I take off\n",
      "from standing and race on down the lane. My heart does not so much feelthat it is in my chest as in my hands, and that I am carrying it along swiftly ,\n",
      "as though I have  become the messenger for what is going on inside of me.\n",
      "Several things flash through my mind: the boy in the wallpaper , the\n",
      "gooseberries, that moment when the bucket pulled me under , the lost heifer ,\n",

      "him there, putting the clamp back down on the gate, closing it. His eyes are\n",
      "down, and he seems to be looking at his hands, at what he is doing. My feet\n",
      "batter on along the rough gravel, along the strip of tatty grass in the middle\n",
      "of our lane. There is only one thing I care about now, and my feet are\n",
      "carrying me there. As soon as he sees me he stops and grows still. I do not\n",
      "hesitate but keep on running towards him and by the time I reach him the\n",
      "gate is open and I am smack against him and lifted into his arms. For a long\n",
      "stretch, he holds me tight. I feel the thumping of my heart, my breaths\n",
      "coming out then my heart and my breaths settling differently . At a point,\n",
      "which feels much later, a sudde n gust blows through the trees  and shakes\n",
      "big, fat raindrops over us. My eyes are closed and I can feel him, the heat of\n",
      "him coming through his good clothes. When I finally open my eyes and\n",
      "look over his shoulder , it is my father I see, coming along strong  and steady ,\n",
      "his walk ing stick in his hand. I hold on as though I’ll drown if I let go, and\n",
      "listen to the woman who seems, in her throat, to be taking it in turns,\n",
      "sobbing and crying, as though she is crying not for one now, but for two. I\n",
